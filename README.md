# Counter.exe
A little python/pygame program to count things

Use Left click to press on all buttons
The number buttons are by how much the counter will increment and decrement
The operations are what operation will be used (Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide)
Saves automatically in a file 'save.txt' (located in the same place as the program) upon closing the window
